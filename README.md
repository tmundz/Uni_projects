# University Projects

## Email Server
This was for my Introduction to Networks class, My group was tasked to write an asymmetric encryption email server. This project was built with Python; we assume the machines will have a static IP address. We used the client's public keys to encrypt the emails, and then the clients used their private keys to decrypt the emails. At the end of this project we presented what we had created while pointing out security falws such as client overloading the system with multiple logins to the server locking out the other users.


## Linux Shell
This is for my Introduction to Operating Systems class, and my partner and I are tasked with building a shell that can execute processes in the foreground and execute them in the background. More functionality that was tasked was the ability to use pipe and redirect. We needed to develop this project using system calls to get environment variables. 


## Shift scheduler
Our group developed an Android app using Java as part of an Introduction to Software Engineering class. The app enables managers to schedule employees, ensuring that someone is always available to open and close the workplace. The project emphasized Agile Scrum practices, providing practical experience with this organizational approach. At the end of each sprint, we presented what was currently being developed.
